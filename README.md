# Home_Sales- PySpark Analysis
# leaflet-challenge

## Overview

This repository contains the completed homework assignment for the **Home_Sales Challenge** for the U of MN Data Analytics & Visualization bootcamp. 

This project uses pyspark to analyze home sales data. The data source links and analysis can be viewed inside the Jupyter Notebook and include several aggregated queries of the home sales data based on pricing, features (#bedrooms, bathrooms, sq footage). Primarily this analysis is to compare runtimes of these basic queries in order to understand differences in speed for standard temp tables, cached temp tables, and partitioned data. 

## Instructions
- Clone repo and open Home_Sales.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Run imports of the listed libraries, and run all cells to view queries and runtime analyses.
